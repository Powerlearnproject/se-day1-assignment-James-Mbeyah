#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering follows a process, for designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. It applies engineering principles to create efficient and user friendly products. In the tech industry software engineering plays a role in building systems methodically to minimize errors enhance quality and streamline development, for scalability.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of high-level languages in the 1950s-1960s made programming more accessible. In the 1970s, structured programming emphasized clear code structure and discipline. The 1980s-1990s saw the rise of object-oriented programming, which introduced key concepts for creating reusable and maintainable code.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Understanding and documenting what the software needs to accomplish.
Design: Creating the architecture and design specifications for the software.
Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design specifications.
Testing: Verify that the software works as intended and identify any defects.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates to address issues or add new features

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall Model is a linear and step, by step method is followed where each stage needs to be finished before moving on to the one. This method is well documented has a structure. Works well for projects with clearly defined requirements.
For example in the case of developing software for a setting where requirements are not expected to change.

Agile Methodology;
A progressive approach that allows for adaptability and modifications throughout the development process. Teams operate in cycles (sprints) to gradually deliver components of the software.
For instance when creating an app, for consumers where user feedback is consistently integrated.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
In a tech team the software developer writes and maintains code adds features, troubleshoots issues and makes sure the software functions smoothly. They collaborate closely with colleagues to grasp project needs and create software solutions.

The quality assurance engineer focuses on testing the software to guarantee it meets standards and requirements. They pinpoint any flaws report them and collaborate with developers to fix problems before the release.

As, for the project manager they oversee the project to ensure it stays on track within budget limits and fulfills all specifications. Managing communication, among stakeholders resolving conflicts and coordinating team efforts are also part of their responsibilities.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: IDEs are important for a complete working space where software engineers can write code, debug it, and test it. These normally involve features such as syntax highlighting, code completion and integrated debugging tools.
Example: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA

Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: A VCS allows a team to follow the changes in their codebase over time, manage different versions and work well without overwriting each other’s work. It guarantees that the changes made to the codes are saved and rolled back if need be.
Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scope Creep: Delays and budget overruns may arise from growing project requirements that are never ending.
Strategy: Put in place rigid change management processes, and prioritize features as per business value.
Technical Debt: A build up of code that is poorly written, needing reworking at a later date.
Strategy: Engage in regular code restructuring and rank good coding during development.
Balancing Innovation with Stability: The introduction of new technologies may disrupt the stability of old systems.
Strategy: Ensure full testing and gradual roll out for system integrity while incorporating new technologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual parts or elements to check if they work as planned.
Importance: Assists in early bug detection during development phase.

Integration Testing: Checking how different units of a program interact when combined together.
Importance: It validates that the system is working as a whole and that all its components are harmonized fully.

System Testing: Test the entire system to make sure it meets the specifications given.
Importance: Validates how the entire system functions under real-life production environment.

Acceptance Testing: Verifying if the software complies with user requirements and business objectives.
Importance: Confirms that users’ goals and stakeholders' expectations are met by this program.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process of designing and refining prompts to engage effectively with AI models. With regard to the relevance and accuracy of the AI response, prompt quality plays a very important role. Therefore, if someone needs correct and useful results from AI programs, they should pay great attention to proper prompt engineering.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about software."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the importance of software engineering in modern technology, highlighting key practices and methodologies."
